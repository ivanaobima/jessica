#LINK TO VIDEO OF FINAL PROJECT
https://youtu.be/5RVcdiKyQJM

ivana downloaded a virus on the tech center computer (anna)
  in my defense, i was trying to convert the youtube audio to mp3. it was for the sake of the project (ivana)

we're at dressicaV3 because i ran out of storage on my onedrive so i deleted v1 and v2. we made v3 on anna's laptop (ivana)

it was a struggle getting the music to play for the main menu and when you start dressing up, but we realized that it was supposed to be in the options page and not the scripts page. we're glad we figured it out (ivana)(anna)

we learned how to use renpy which was fun and not to convert youtube link to mp3 on sketchy websites (ivana)(anna)
    in my defense again, it was the very first link so i thought it was ok. i used to do this all the time as a kid and it was safe but i guess times       changed :( (ivana)

    i enjoyed finding the pictures tbh. and seeing the game actually work was super satisfying (ivana)
    I also enjoyed the search for photos and coming up with ideas of accessories and clothes to use. (anna)
      we were atually going to add a yamaka/kippa as an accessory, but because the character is female we thought it might be inappropriate since it is       usually worn by males.(anna and ivana)
      we did pick scarves with a python pattern because it's pythoN!!!!!
      and florida man tshirts to commemorate the missed florida man lecture(anna and ivana)

another problem:
  we had a third skirt, but it was in the code but didnt show up in the game :(

  also, there WAS in fact music in the game(SUCCESS!), but we had out computer sound off during recording, so you couldn't hear the song. if you were curious, this was the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um8qQ4hAEDM&ab_channel=MarcelusCastleRain

  ****just for the video though i added the song in the background with an editor for enhanced user experience.
