1) Dressica (or Cheese Danish)

2) A fun dress up game for girls(and boys).

3) We plan to make a dress-up game catered towards young girls. We would like to use Ren.py to get this done. The dress up game should consist of a wardrobe or closet of 2D tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories 
and one 2D model to put those items on. There will be text buttons and the user should be able to click on an item and it will show up on the character. Hopefully, we can add music in the background.

6) GOOD outcome: We should absolutely accomplish a character and at least three tops and three bottoms to choose from.

7) GREAT outcome: We think we can accomplish making a variety of options, have a pretty character, and plenty detail in the items.

8) BEST outcome: We hope to make a game with all the details above in addition to more detail to clothing, backgrounds, and characters, and even music in the back.

9) In addition to the skills we know now, we'd have to learn how to make textbuttons and add music. We'll be working with images a lot here, so it's important to know how to work with those and make sure they:
1) show up, 2) respond well to the code, and 3) exist in harmony with each other!
